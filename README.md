# Web Components Try out
This is a very simple and basic implementation of web components, just to play around with its API and see how it looks like
Don't expect much here, most of what I have here was based on what I got from this course [PluralSight] https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/vanilla-web-components-practical-guide/table-of-contents

The main goal here is just to show what web components can do in a very basic level.

## Folder Structure
In the Root folder you can find a basic index.html and table.html, just to simulate the navigation component work.

In the `components` folder you may find the 3 components I wrote:


- table: A simple and basic table component with a sorting capability, the data is using `faker`

- star-rating: This is completely based on that course with some tweaks, but, it is a simple component to rate things from 0 to 5 and provides some styling capabilities.

- slide-menu: Same, basically what I got from that course with some tweaks. This is a simple slide menu, from left, that provides some pre cooked themes and works with slots to configure it.

## Scripts
No tests for this since this is just a basic implementation, and I didn't want to add any dependencies.

To check it locally:
- `npm run start`
